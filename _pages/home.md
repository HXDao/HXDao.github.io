I am currently pursuing the Ph.D degree advised by [A/Prof. Yue Wu](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/wuyue/) with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Collaborative Intelligence Systems, Ministry of Education, Xidian University. I was admitted to the School of Computer Science and Technology at Xidian University to pursue a master's degree in 2020. In 2022, I continued my studies towards a doctoral degree in a combined master's and doctoral program. My research interests include deep learning, 3D computer vision, and remote sensing image understanding.
